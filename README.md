# CANDEX: CAtchment NetcDf EXtractor
This package allows you to extract and aggregate the relevant values from a
cfconventions compliant netcdf files given shapefiles.

CANDEX is a collection of functions that allows extraction of the data from a NetCDF file for a given shapefile such as a basin, catchment. It can map gridded data or model output to any given shapefile and provide area average for a target variable.

## Speed and Efficiency

Candex is very efficient as it uses pandas `groupby` functionality. Remapping of the entire north American domain from ERA5 with resolution of 0.25 degree to 500,000 subbasins of MERIT-Hydro watershed for 7 variables in 1.2 seconds for one time step (the time varying from device to device and depending on the source netCDF files sizes and their temporal aggregation).

## Example

1. [Remap a regular lat/lon gridded data or model to any shapefile](./candex/example_regular_lat_lon.ipynb)
2. [Remap a rotate lat/lon gridded data or model to any shapefile](./candex/example_rotated_lat_lon.ipynb)
3. Remap a irregular shapefile data, such as Thiessen polygon for example, to any shapefile such as sub-basin.
4. Extract the data for multiple points (such as location of stations, cities, etc) from the grided or irregular data

## The code can be used for the following purposes:

1. Remapping the relevant forcing variables, such as precipitation or temperature and other variables for the effortless model set up. This transfer can be from Thiessen polygon or gridded data, for example, to computational units, hydrological model for example.
2. Remapping the output of a hydrological or land surface model to force another model, such as providing the gridded model output in sub-basin for routing.
3. Extraction of single or multiple points from the gridded or irregular data for comparison with gauges data, for example.

The two figures show remapping of the gridded temperature from ERA5 data set to subbasin of South Saskatchewan River at Medicine Hat.
